"'''One of Those Days'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Whitney Houston]], from her fifth studio album ''[[Just Whitney]]'' (2002). Written by [[Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs|Kevin Briggs]], Dwight Renolds, Patrice Stewart, [[Ernest Isley]], [[Marvin Isley]], Christopher Jasper, Kelly Isley, [[Ronald Isley]], and [[Rudolph Isley]], and produced by Briggs, the song was released as the second single from the album, following the under-performance of the [[lead single]] "[[Whatchulookinat]]", on October 29, 2002 through [[Arista Records]]. A mid-tempo [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] track, "One of Those Days" samples [[The Isley Brothers]]' song "[[Between the Sheets (song)|Between the Sheets]]" (1983), and its lyrics speak about getting away from the stress of daily life.
